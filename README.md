# Python Basics Demos

This repository contains a series of Python demos designed to teach the fundamentals of Python programming, with a focus on concepts that are particularly relevant for understanding LLMs and AI.

## Demo Structure

Each demo file focuses on a specific concept and includes:
- Clear examples with comments
- Practical demonstrations
- Challenges for students to practice

### Current Demos

1. `01_variables_and_types.py`: Basic data types and variables
2. `02_lists_and_tuples.py`: Working with collections
3. `03_functions.py`: Function creation and usage

## How to Use

1. Start with `01_variables_and_types.py` to understand basic Python concepts
2. Move through each demo in sequence
3. Try the challenges at the end of each file
4. Experiment with modifying the examples

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, functions, etc.)

## Running the Demos

Each demo can be run independently using:
```bash
python demos/01_variables_and_types.py
```

## Learning Path

1. Start with basic data types and variables
2. Learn about collections (lists and tuples)
3. Understand functions and code organization
4. Practice with the provided challenges

## Contributing

Feel free to add more demos or improve existing ones. Each demo should:
- Focus on a specific concept
- Include clear examples
- Provide practical challenges
- Be well-documented
